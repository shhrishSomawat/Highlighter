# Highlighter
Developed a dynamic search-highlighting tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project enables users to search for a specific word, with the application highlighting instances of the searched word dynamically on the webpage. The implementation showcases my proficiency in front-end web development and user-friendly interactive features.
